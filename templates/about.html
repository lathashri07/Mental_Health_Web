    Healware is a digital therapy platform aimed at improving mental wellness through AI-powered tools, 
    emotional detection, and guided therapy modules. 
    Which aims to deliver targeted therapeutic interventions using technology-driven tools. By combining artificial intelligence (AI), behavioural analytics, and psychological frameworks, these platforms offer tailored therapy content, mood tracking, virtual consultations, and continuous emotional support — all accessible from a user’s phone or computer. This project proposes the development of a Personalized Digital Therapy Platform that empowers users to manage their mental well-being through interactive therapy modules, real-time support systems, and progress tracking. It is designed to adapt to each user’s unique psychological needs and preferences, ensuring a more engaging and effective mental health journey.
